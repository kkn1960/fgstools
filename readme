      fgstools.sql   SQL script to create of FGS Tools system tables

      After that you have to create FGS Tools system tables by executing fgstools.sql in any SQL tool, for example in phpMyAdmin

Very important!

Before execution of the fgstools.sql SQL script check that database tables related to the Configurator do not have the same names as your database tables. Your tables with the same names will be dropped and its data lost!


Configuration variables are stored in the file include/config.php.

To set database connection you should find "Database name && connection parameters" section in the file include/config.php:

$dbname="your database name";
$gaDbConnect["your database name "]=array("server"=>" your database host", "dbname"=>" your database name ", "dbms"=>"Mysql", "codepage"=>"utf8", "user"=>"user name", "password"=>"user password");

The "dbms" parameter must be the name of the database driver. FGS Tools includes the Mysql driver for MySql DBMS.
